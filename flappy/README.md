###FlappyTayyip

[Flappy Tayyip](https://dombili.github.io/FlappyTayyip) is a clone of the terrible yet extremely popular game called Flappy Bird. The only difference between Flappy Bird and Flappy Tayyip is the fact that you have the privilege of playing as our renowned and glorious leader, Kim-Jo... *cough* Recep Tayyip Erdogan. So basically this is my pitiful attempt to turn a terrible game into a great one. I think it's pretty obvious that I've achieved that.

###Where to play

And of course, as always, all the glory to our leader.
